CODEWARS

I have a lot of fun on [Codewars]! Codewars challenges you to make short ruby methods that do cool things (like transforming a string into binary, authenticating a user, implementing *flatten* and so on).

It is through Codewars that I learn how to use many different ruby methods, so I thought I'd share some snippets of my Codewars answers on Github.
