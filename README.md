CODEWARS
===

I have a lot of fun on [Codewars]! 

Codewars is a website that challenges you to make short ruby methods. These methods do cool things like transform a string into binary, authenticate a user, implement *flatten* and so on.

It is through Codewars that I learn how to use many different ruby methods, so I thought I'd share some snippets of my Codewars answers on Github.
