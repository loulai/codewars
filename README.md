CODEWARS
===

I have a lot of fun on [Codewars]! 

Codewars is a website that challenges you to make short ruby methods. These methods do cool things like transform a string into binary, authenticate a user, implement *flatten* and so on.

It is through Codewars that I learn how to use many different ruby methods, so I thought I'd share some snippets of my Codewars answers on Github.

The first few lines of each file will be a copy-and-paste of the instructions Codewars has given me. For the most part, Codewars expects me to return only one method (sometimes it does a bunch of stuff that I would usually separate into several shorter methods). 

The end result is likely to have been refactored, so to see how I originally started out, look at my commit history. Also, I don't always push my answers to Git. Only some when I feel like it and like my answer.
